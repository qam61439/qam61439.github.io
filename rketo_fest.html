	<label>Time remaining until the Rural South Keto Festival Begins: </label><strong><label id="kfest"></label></strong><hr>
	
		  <p>The <strong>Rural South Keto Festival</strong> is an event in which communities from all around can 
		  get together and celebrate better health and share recipes.</p>
		  
		  
		  <p>There will be live music and vendors from all around the area as well.  The theme of the festival this
		  year will be seasonal side items for the fall.</p>
		  
		  <p>We will be having a side item contest this year with a first place prize of <strong>$500</strong>, a second place prize
		  of <strong>$250</strong> and a third place prize of <strong>$100</strong>.  There will be a panel of 5 judges with different backgrounds and
		  a love for great food!
		  
		  <p>If you would like to enter in the side item contest, please use the Contact Us form and leave your contact
		  information along with selecting 'Yes' under the question "Would you like for someone to call you?".  This is
		  to confirm that your intention is to enter into the contest along with the dish you will be bringing.</p>
		  
      <h2>Common Questions</h2>		
		  <p><strong>What kind of food will vendors have?</strong><br>
		  Rest assured, there will definitely be BBQ.  We are also working on having a seafood vendor come out with
		  some keto-friendly seafood options.</p>
	  
		  <p><strong>What is the date and time for the event?</strong><br>
		  Saturday, September 2, 2023.  The event begins at 10:00am.</p>
		  
		  <p><strong>Who are the food contest judges?</strong><br>
		  To keep the contest as fair and neutral as possible, we will not be providing judge names prior to the event.
		  Rest assured, the judging panel will be diverse to eliminate the possibility of certain food types being
		  overly liked or overly disliked due to similar cultural preference.</p>

		  <p><strong>How can I become a judge?</strong><br>
		  Reach out to us via the Contact Us form and we will set up time to interview you for the role.  We will also
		  select different judges each year.  So if you are not a judge this year, you may be able to become one in upcoming
		  years.</p>


		  <p><strong>What about parking?</strong><br>
		  Since the event is taking place in a rural area, there will be acres upon acres to park vehicles.  Additionally,
		  there will be plenty of space to bring lawn chairs if you so wish.</p>

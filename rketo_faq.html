	  <p><strong>What are some examples of what I can eat on Keto?</strong><br>
	  Take waffles for instance.  If you love waffles, you can still eat them, but substitute
	  out regular flour with almond flour, which is lower in carbs and use a low glycemic sugar 
	  substitute.  Also, use a syrup that is sugar-free (that is also low-glycemic).  If you love bacon and eggs, you can 
	  still eat bacon and eggs.  Just make sure the bacon is not cured with sugar.  Additionally, you 
	  can have fruit such as strawberries orphans blueberries.  Keep in mind, the goal is low carbs.</p>
     
	  <p><strong>I can eat bacon and eggs and actually improve my health?  Get outta here!</strong><br>
	  Absolutely.  Here's one even better.  You can still eat all the BBQ you like.  You can eat whatever meats you like.
	  Just make sure the amount of carbs you consume with it are as low as possible.  It helps to have low-carb 
	  vegetable dishes along with meals whenever possible to get the best health benefits out of your meal.  Additionally,
	  season your food as you've always done in the past.  Minus the sugar!</p>
	  
	  <p><strong>I've done some reading and I've heard of intermittent fasting.  What is this?</strong><br>
	  Ever heard of food that "sticks to the ribs"?  The fat is what does that.  It satiates your hunger and
	  prevents the ongoing need to eat, which is usually common with high carbohydrate foods.  Addionally, there are
	  studies that mention health benefits provided by intermittent fasting.  You will not feel as if you are starving
	  yourself and the "hangry" episodes will become a thing of the past.</p>

	  <p><strong>What is "Keto Flu"?  I don't want to get sick!!!</strong><br>
	  In a nutshell, when you make adjustments to your diet, your body has to make adjustments on how to function
	  and what to draw energy from.  Keto flu is what you feel when your body transitions to running on fat as opposed 
	  to carbohydrates.  Typically, taking electrolytes during this period (sugar free, of course) is a good way to
	  make it through this time period.</p>
	  
	  <p><strong>What about cheat days?  I still want to eat certain foods with my family.</strong><br>
	  You can still have your cheat days, but make it infrequent.  Especially during the early timeframe.
	  However, there needs to be a clear distinction between cheat days and normal days.  Cheat days should be
	  infrequent to achieve the maximum benefits of keto.</p>
	  
	  <p><strong>Avocados???  Yuck!!!</strong><br>
	  Avocados are very healthy and have health benefits for keto, but you don't have to eat avocados to be successful with keto.  Smile!</p>
	  
	  <p><strong>I see you mention meat quite frequently, but I am vegan/vegetarian.  Is keto for me?</strong><br>
	  Absolutely!  There are many ways to achieve the benefits of a ketogentic diet.  There will be a bit more effort
	  involved, but this can be easily achieved.</p>

	  <p><strong>Ok, I get it.  Cut out sweets and starches.  Anything else I should cut out?</strong><br>
	  There are some cooking oils made from seeds (such as vegetable oil or canola oil) are usually not a healthy source of fat.  There are other oils that
	  can be used in place of these that provide better health benefits.</p>

	  <p><strong>This is weird.  Eat fatty foods and improve my health?</strong><br>
	  Much like anything else in life, taking on a keto diet is a personal decision.  However, many have succeded 
	  and it is a decision that both you and your doctor will have to agree on.  We are here simply to provide an
	  alternative to the norm to improve health where many have had past issues.</p>
	  
	  <p><strong>Ok, this sounds interesting.  Anything else you think I should know?</strong><br>
	  Do some research and keep it as simple as possible.  While there are certain foods that you may have deep
	  attachments to, look at the big picture.  Also, there are cookbooks that can help.  Your meals do not have 
	  to be fancy at all.  Just keep it simple, keep the carbs down and make sure your food is as natural as possible.
	  There is an old saying that if you can't grow it or kill it, you shouldn't eat it.</p>

      <h2>Keto Testimonials</h2>
      <blockquote> I noticed many positive changes.  However, the main one is that I plain and
	  simply feel better.  No more random aches and pains and I sleep a lot better in
	  addition to the weight loss.</blockquote>
      <blockquote> I didn't have any health issues per se, but I tried it anyway to see
	  what the hoopla was about.  I have to admit, I do feel better and as a bonus, my skin
	  glows quite a bit!!!</blockquote>
      <blockquote> I no longer feel hungry all the time!  I guess this is what they mean
	  when I hear people say food sticking to the ribs.</blockquote>

		  <p><strong>Chopped Pork BBQ</strong><br>
		  Simple, classic and your dad, granddad or uncle may already have this in place!<br><br>
		  Ingredients:<br>
		   <ul>
			 <li>1 Boston Butt</li>
			 <li>Salt</li>
			 <li><strong>Optional:</strong> Pepper</li>
			 <li><strong>Optional:</strong> Sugar-free store bought or homemade BBQ rub.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <strong>Directions:</strong><br>
		  Season meat and bake (or smoke) for 1.5 hours per pound (until temperature reaches 195 to 205 depending on preference).  Serve with your favorite sugar-free BBQ sauce.

		  160-170 to decrease cooking time and decrease the risk of oversmoking.</p><br>

		  <p><strong>Mayonnaise</strong><br>
		  Once you try homemade mayo, you will likely never want store bought mayonnaise again!<br>
		  Ingredients:<br>
		   <ul>
			 <li>1 Cup Extra Light Olive Oil</li>
			 <li>1 Egg</li>
			 <li>1/2 Teaspoon Dijon Mustard (or other mustard types if you'd like to experiment)</li>
			 <li>1 Tablespoon Vinegar<strong> or </strong>Lemon Juice  (<strong>Note: </strong> White vinegar is the norm, but other vinegars can be used.)</li>
			 <li>1/4 Teaspoon Keto-Friendly Sweetener</li>				 
			 <li>1/2 Teaspoon Salt</li>
			 <li><strong>Optional: </strong>1 to 3 Tablespoons of water.  This makes the mayonnaise "fluffy".</li>		 
		  </ul><br>
		  
		  <strong>Directions:</strong><br>
		  Using an immersion blender, crack the egg into a cup or jar (which the blender will fit into).  Then add 
		  remaining ingredients except for oil on top of the egg.  Lastly, pour the oil into the jar.  Place the immersion
		  blender into the jar and pulse until the mixture begins to emulsify (look creamy).  Then keep pulsing and 
		  work the blender upward until the contents look like mayo.  After this is complete, add a lid onto it and place
		  into the refrigerator.  <br>
		  <strong>Note:</strong> This recipe can also be made with a standard blender or a food processor.
		  You will have to experiment to get the proper texture.  (Typically, the smaller the bottom of the mixing device, the better.)

			 <li>1/4 Teaspoon Keto-Friendly Sweetener</li>				 
			 <li>1 Tablespoon sugar-free sweet relish</li>	
			 <li><strong>Optional: </strong>1/16 Teaspoon Xanthan Gum (This keeps the cole slaw from running).</li>

		  </ul><br>
		  <strong>Directions:</strong><br>
		  Combine all ingredents in a bowl and mix together.  If using Xanthan Gum, ensure it is mixed quickly into the mixture

	<h2>Meal Ideas</h2>
		<div class="ketobox">
			<div class="keto1">	
				<p><strong>BBQ</strong><br>
					  Continue to make BBQ the same way you always have.  Use sugar-free sauce if using store bought sauce.  If making homemade sauce, 
					  use keto-friendly sugar substitutes or sugar-free sweeteners instead of traditional sweet ingredients. <br><i>Some regional BBQ sauces
					  such as Eastern NC sauce are already keto-friendly in their original form.</i><br></p>
				</div>

			<div class="keto2">				
				<p><strong>Greens</strong><br>
					  Whether it be turnip greens (i.e. turnip salad for some), mustard greens or collard greens, these are usually keto friendly.  For those
					  that add a bit of a sweetener to their greens will need to find a sugar substitute.  However, traditional family recipes can otherwise
					  be maintained.<br></p>
				
				</div>

			<div class="keto3">					
				<p><strong>Breakfast</strong><br>
					  Eggs and bacon (or whatever meat you prefer) are fine. There are low carb recipes for oatmeal, grits, pancakes and waffles.
					  Additionally, vegetables can be substituted in for side items.  An example of this is using grated cauliflower to make a healthier
					  hash brown.<br></p>
				</div>
			<div class="keto4">				
			<p><strong>Stews</strong><br>
					  Substitute out potatoes with lower carb root vegetables such as turnips, radish or rutabaga. The classic beef stew recipe with beef
					  chunks, potatoes, onions and optionally carrots can still be done by swapping out the potatoes for one fo the aforementioned lower
					  carb root vegetables.<br></p>
				</div>					  

			<div class="keto5">				
				<p><strong>Fish</strong><br>
					  Frying fish in a cast iron skillet is a southern tradition.  While wheat flour nor traditional seed oils are keto, fried fish can
					  achieved using unflavored protein powder, almond flour and either avocado oil or light olive oil.  Experiment with seasoning and build
					  a unique recipe!<br></p>	  
 				</div>       
			
			<div class="keto6">				
				<p><strong>Homemade Sugar-Free Ice Cream</strong><br>
					  Using a low-glycemic sugar substitutes, the same tradition of making homemade ice cream can still be done.  While there will need
					  to be some experimentation to revamp your family's recipe, this can be done.  The benefit in that by making the recipe keto, the
					  ice cream will be extremely creamy and flavorful for all to enjoy!<br></p>

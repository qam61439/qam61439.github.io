      <h1>What is Keto?</h1>

	  <p><strong>The Ketogenic Diet</strong>, more commonly known as <strong>Keto</strong>
		is a high-fat, low carbohydrate diet.  There are many benefits to the keto diet including
		weight loss, improvements with blood sugar/insulin levels, better control of appetite,
		stress relief, mood improvements, reduced inflammation and improved blood pressure.</p>
      <p>As with any diet, there will be a need for improved food choices and exercise.  The purpose 
	  of this site is to bring awareness of new options in food choices, which many are quite
	  familiar and may benefit health on long-term basis.  As always, is recommended that you 
	  consult with a medical doctor prior to beginning any diet/exercise regimen.</p>
      
	  <h2>Keto Fundamentals</h2>
      <p>Keto consists of low carb, high fat and moderate protein meals.  With this being the case,
	  to be successful with keto, the following will need to be removed from daily meals:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Sugar contains a high amount of carbohydrates and needs
		 to be removed for the purpose of regulating blood sugar/insulin response.</li>
         <li><strong>Flour</strong>: Flour is a foundational component for a lot of meals such as
		 biscuits, pancakes, waffles, fried foods, etc.  There are viable substitutes to flour that
		 can be used to be successful with keto.</li>
         <li><strong>Starches</strong>: Starchy vegetables such as corn and potatoes will need to 
		 be removed from the diet as well to have results.  There are other vegetables that are 
		 delicious and much lower in carbohydrates.</li>
		 <li><strong>Some Fruits</strong>: Berries are typically fine in that they are low
		 in carbohydrates; however other fruits are usually high in carbohydrates and do not align
		 with the low carbohydrate requirement of the keto diet.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are general guidelines to take into consideration when considering a keto diet.</p>
      <h2>Our Goal</h2>
      <p>For many decades, there have been common health-related problems that are prevalent in
	  rural southern areas and it doesn't have to be that way.  There are many diets to consider,
	  but keto is a very good solution for those that love flavorful food and are willing to modify or give up
	  certain traditional foods for the majority of the time to maintain solid health.</p>
